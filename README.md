# NTNU

Code written for some of my courses taken while at NTNU (Norwegian University of Science and Technology)

## Courses

### Artificial Intelligence Methods (AI-2) - TDT4171

http://www.idi.ntnu.no/emner/tdt4171/

1. Forward-backwards algorithm
2. Learning to rank using Gradient Descent

### Sub-symbolic AI Methods - IT3708

http://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/IT3708#tab=omEmnet

1. Evolutionary algorithm written from scratch in C++ used to solve the one-max problem and evolve strategies for the Colonel Blotto game
2. Evolutionary algorithm for evolving spiking neuron behavior
3. Evolutionary algorithm for evolving the weights of a continous time recurrent neural network (CTRNN) used to control a minimally cognitive agent. The agent will sense falling objects of various sizes and must evolve the ability to a) intercept objects smaller than itself, but b) avoid objects of its own size or larger.
4. A controller for Swarm Behavior in Webots based on Brooks Architecture
